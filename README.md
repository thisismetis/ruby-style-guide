## Source Code Layout

* Use two **spaces** per indentation level (aka soft tabs). No hard tabs.

  ```Ruby
  # bad - four spaces
  def some_method
      do_something
  end

  # good
  def some_method
    do_something
  end
  ```

* Don't use `;` to separate statements and expressions. As a
  corollary - use one expression per line.

  ```Ruby
  # bad
  puts 'foobar'; # superfluous semicolon

  puts 'foo'; puts 'bar' # two expressions on the same line

  # good
  puts 'foobar'

  puts 'foo'
  puts 'bar'

  puts 'foo', 'bar' # this applies to puts in particular
  ```

* Avoid single-line methods.

  ```Ruby
  # bad
  def too_much; something; something_else; end

  # bad
  def no_braces_method; body end

  # bad
  def no_braces_method; body; end

  # bad
  def some_method() body end

  # good
  def some_method
    body
  end
  ```

* Use spaces around operators, after commas, colons and semicolons, around `{`
  and before `}`. Whitespace might be (mostly) irrelevant to the Ruby
  interpreter, but its proper use is the key to writing easily
  readable code.

  ```Ruby
  sum = 1 + 2
  a, b = 1, 2
  [1, 2, 3].each { |e| puts e }
  class FooError < StandardError; end
  ```

  The only exception, regarding operators, is the exponent operator:

  ```Ruby
  # bad
  e = M * c ** 2

  # good
  e = M * c**2
  ```

  `{` and `}` deserve a bit of clarification, since they are used
  for block and hash literals, as well as embedded expressions in
  strings.

  ```Ruby
  # bad
  {one: 1, two: 2}

  # good - space after { and before }
  { one: 1, two: 2 }
  ```

  As far as string interpolation goes, to differentiate it we leave off the spaces:

  ```Ruby
  # bad
  "string#{ expr }"

  # good - no spaces
  "string#{expr}"

  ```

* No spaces after `(`, `[` or before `]`, `)`.

  ```Ruby
  some(arg).other
  [1, 2, 3].size
  ```

* No space after `!`.

  ```Ruby
  # bad
  ! something

  # good
  !something
  ```

* Indent `when` as deep as `case`. I know that many would disagree
  with this one, but it's the style established in both "The Ruby
  Programming Language" and "Programming Ruby".

  ```Ruby
  # bad
  case
    when song.name == 'Misty'
      puts 'Not again!'
    when song.duration > 120
      puts 'Too long!'
    when Time.now.hour > 21
      puts "It's too late"
    else
      song.play
  end

  # good
  case
  when song.name == 'Misty'
    puts 'Not again!'
  when song.duration > 120
    puts 'Too long!'
  when Time.now.hour > 21
    puts "It's too late"
  else
    song.play
  end
  ```

* Use empty lines between method definitions and also to break up a method
  into logical paragraphs internally.

  ```Ruby
  def some_method
    data = initialize(options)

    data.manipulate!

    data.result
  end

  def some_method
    result
  end
  ```

* Add a comma after every parameter in a multi-line method call. It makes
  it easier to move parameters around without adding/removing commas.

  ```Ruby
  # bad - easier to move/add/remove parameters, but still not preferred
  some_method(
               size,
               count,
               color,
             )

  # bad
  some_method(size, count, color, )

  # good
  some_method(size, count, color)
  ```

* Use spaces around the `=` operator when assigning default values to method parameters:

  ```Ruby
  # bad
  def some_method(arg1=:default, arg2=nil, arg3=[])
    # do something...
  end

  # good
  def some_method(arg1 = :default, arg2 = nil, arg3 = [])
    # do something...
  end
  ```

  While several Ruby books suggest the first style, the second is much more prominent
  in practice (and arguably a bit more readable).

* When continuing a chained method invocation on
    another line keep the `.` on the second line.

    ```Ruby
    # bad - need to consult first line to understand second line
    one.two.three.
      four

    # good - it's immediately clear what's going on the second line
    one.two.three
      .four
    ```

* Align the parameters of a method call if they span more than one
  line. When aligning parameters is not appropriate due to line-length
  constraints, single indent for the lines after the first is also
  acceptable.

  ```Ruby
  # starting point (line is too long)
  def send_mail(source)
    Mailer.deliver(to: 'bob@example.com', from: 'us@example.com', subject: 'Important message', body: source.text)
  end

  # bad (double indent)
  def send_mail(source)
    Mailer.deliver(
        to: 'bob@example.com',
        from: 'us@example.com',
        subject: 'Important message',
        body: source.text)
  end

  # good
  def send_mail(source)
    Mailer.deliver(to: 'bob@example.com',
                   from: 'us@example.com',
                   subject: 'Important message',
                   body: source.text)
  end

  # good (normal indent)
  def send_mail(source)
    Mailer.deliver(
      to: 'bob@example.com',
      from: 'us@example.com',
      subject: 'Important message',
      body: source.text
    )
  end
  ```

* Align the elements of array literals spanning multiple lines.

  ```Ruby
  # bad - single indent
  menu_item = ['Spam', 'Spam', 'Spam', 'Spam', 'Spam', 'Spam', 'Spam', 'Spam',
    'Baked beans', 'Spam', 'Spam', 'Spam', 'Spam', 'Spam']

  # good
  menu_item = [
    'Spam', 'Spam', 'Spam', 'Spam', 'Spam', 'Spam', 'Spam', 'Spam',
    'Baked beans', 'Spam', 'Spam', 'Spam', 'Spam', 'Spam'
  ]
  ```

* Add underscores to large numeric literals to improve their readability.

  ```Ruby
  # bad - how many 0s are there?
  num = 1000000

  # good - much easier to parse for the human brain
  num = 1_000_000
  ```

* Limit lines to 80 characters.

* Avoid trailing whitespace.

* Don't use block comments ever. They cannot be preceded by whitespace and are not
  as easy to spot as regular comments.

  ```Ruby
  # bad
  =begin
  comment line
  another comment line
  =end

  # good
  # comment line
  # another comment line
  ```

## Syntax

* Use `::` only to reference constants(this includes classes and
  modules) and constructors (like `Array()` or `Nokogiri::HTML()`).
  Never use `::` for regular method invocation.

  ```Ruby
  # bad
  SomeClass::some_method
  some_object::some_method

  # good
  SomeClass.some_method
  some_object.some_method
  SomeModule::SomeClass::SOME_CONST
  SomeModule::SomeClass()
  ```

* Use `def` with parentheses when there are arguments. Omit the
  parentheses when the method doesn't accept any arguments.

   ```Ruby
   # bad
   def some_method()
     # body omitted
   end

   # good
   def some_method
     # body omitted
   end

   # bad
   def some_method_with_arguments arg1, arg2
     # body omitted
   end

   # good
   def some_method_with_arguments(arg1, arg2)
     # body omitted
   end
   ```

* Never use `for`.

  ```Ruby
  arr = [1, 2, 3]

  # bad
  for elem in arr do
    puts elem
  end

  # note that elem is accessible outside of the for loop
  elem #=> 3

  # good
  arr.each { |elem| puts elem }

  # elem is not accessible outside each's block
  elem #=> NameError: undefined local variable or method `elem'
  ```

* Never use `then` for multi-line `if/unless`.

  ```Ruby
  # bad
  if some_condition then
    # body omitted
  end

  # good
  if some_condition
    # body omitted
  end
  ```

* Always put the condition on the same line as the `if`/`unless` in a multi-line conditional.

  ```Ruby
  # bad
  if
    some_condition
    do_something
    do_something_else
  end

  # good
  if some_condition
    do_something
    do_something_else
  end
  ```

* Avoid using the ternary operator '?' unless it's in a single line method, and even then sparingly.

  ```Ruby
  # bad
  result = some_condition ? something : something_else
  do_stuff

  # okay
  def result
    some_condition ? something : something_else
  end
  ```

  ```
* Never inline an `if` conditional.

  ```Ruby
  # bad
  result = if some_condition then something else something_else end
  ```


* Use one expression per branch in a ternary operator. This
  also means that ternary operators must not be nested. Prefer
  `if/else` constructs in these cases.

  ```Ruby
  # bad
  some_condition ? (nested_condition ? nested_something : nested_something_else) : something_else
  ```

* Leverage the fact that `if` and `case` are expressions which return a result.

  ```Ruby
  # bad
  if condition
    result = x
  else
    result = y
  end

  # good
  result =
    if condition
      x
    else
      y
    end

  #better
  def get_result
    if condition
      x
    else
      y
    end
  end
  # ... somewhere else
  result = get_result
  ```

* Use `!` instead of `not`.

  ```Ruby
  # bad - braces are required because of op precedence
  x = (not something)

  # good
  x = !something
  ```

* Avoid the use of `!!`.

  ```Ruby
  # bad
  x = 'test'
  # obscure nil check
  if !!x
    # body omitted
  end

  x = false
  # double negation is useless on booleans
  !!x # => false

  # good
  x = 'test'
  unless x.nil?
    # body omitted
  end
  ```

* The `and` and `or` keywords are banned. It's just not worth
  it. Always use `&&` and `||` instead.

  ```Ruby
  # bad
  # boolean expression
  if some_condition and some_other_condition
    do_something
  end

  # control flow
  document.saved? or document.save!

  # good
  # boolean expression
  if some_condition && some_other_condition
    do_something
  end

  # control flow
  document.saved? || document.save!
  ```

* Avoid trailing conditionals

  ```Ruby
  # bad
  do_something if some_condition

  # good
  if some_condition
    do_something
  end
  ```

* Favor `if` over `unless` for negative conditions (by extracting
  methods out for the negative).

  ```Ruby
  # bad
  unless won
    do_something
  end

  # okay
  if !won
    do_something
  end

  # good
  if lost
    do_something
  end
  ```

* Don't use parentheses around the condition of an `if/unless/while/until`.

  ```Ruby
  # bad
  if (x > 10)
    # body omitted
  end

  # good
  if x > 10
    # body omitted
  end
  ```

* Use `Kernel#loop` instead of `while/until` when you need an infinite loop.

    ```ruby
    # bad
    while true
      do_something
    end

    until false
      do_something
    end

    # good
    loop do
      do_something
    end
    ```

* Use `Kernel#loop` with `break` rather than `begin/end/until` or `begin/end/while` for post-loop tests.

  ```Ruby
  # bad
  begin
    puts val
    val += 1
  end while val < 0

  # good
  loop do
    puts val
    val += 1
    break unless val < 0
  end
  ```

* Omit parentheses around parameters for methods that are part of an
  internal DSL (e.g. Rake, Rails, RSpec), methods that have
  "keyword" status in Ruby (e.g. `attr_reader`, `puts`) and attribute
  access methods. Use parentheses around the arguments of all other
  method invocations.

  ```Ruby
  class Person
    attr_reader :name, :age

    # omitted
  end

  temperance = Person.new('Temperance', 30)
  temperance.name

  puts temperance.age

  x = Math.sin(y)
  array.delete(e)

  bowling.score.should == 0
  ```

* Omit the outer braces around an implicit options hash.

  ```Ruby
  # bad
  user.set({ name: 'John', age: 45, permissions: { read: true } })

  # good
  user.set(name: 'John', age: 45, permissions: { read: true })
  ```

* Omit both the outer braces and parentheses for methods that are
  part of an internal DSL.

  ```Ruby
  class Person < ActiveRecord::Base
    # bad
    validates(:name, { presence: true, length: { within: 1..10 } })

    # good
    validates :name, presence: true, length: { within: 1..10 }
  end
  ```

* Omit parentheses for method calls with no arguments.

  ```Ruby
  # bad
  Kernel.exit!()
  2.even?()
  fork()
  'test'.upcase()

  # good
  Kernel.exit!
  2.even?
  fork
  'test'.upcase
  ```

* Prefer `{...}` over `do...end` for single-line blocks.  Avoid using
  `{...}` for multi-line blocks (multiline chaining is always
  ugly). Always use `do...end` for "control flow" and "method
  definitions" (e.g. in Rakefiles and certain DSLs).  Avoid `do...end`
  when chaining.

  ```Ruby
  names = ['Bozhidar', 'Steve', 'Sarah']

  # bad
  names.each do |name|
    puts name
  end

  # good
  names.each { |name| puts name }

  # bad
  names.select do |name|
    name.start_with?('S')
  end.map { |name| name.upcase }

  # good
  names.select { |name| name.start_with?('S') }.map { |name| name.upcase }
  ```

  Some will argue that multiline chaining would look OK with the use of {...}, but they should
  ask themselves - is this code really readable and can the blocks' contents be extracted into
  nifty methods?

* Consider using explicit block argument to avoid writing block
  literal that just passes its arguments to another block. Beware of
  the performance impact, though, as the block gets converted to a
  Proc.

  ```Ruby
  require 'tempfile'

  # bad
  def with_tmp_dir
    Dir.mktmpdir do |tmp_dir|
      Dir.chdir(tmp_dir) { |dir| yield dir }  # block just passes arguments
    end
  end

  # good
  def with_tmp_dir(&block)
    Dir.mktmpdir do |tmp_dir|
      Dir.chdir(tmp_dir, &block)
    end
  end

  with_tmp_dir do |dir|
    puts "dir is accessible as a parameter and pwd is set: #{dir}"
  end
  ```

* Avoid `return` where not required for flow of control.

  ```Ruby
  # bad
  def some_method(some_arr)
    return some_arr.size
  end

  # good
  def some_method(some_arr)
    some_arr.size
  end
  ```

* Avoid `self` where not required. (It is only required when calling a self write accessor.)

  ```Ruby
  # bad
  def ready?
    if self.last_reviewed_at > self.last_updated_at
      self.worker.update(self.content, self.options)
      self.status = :in_progress
    end
    self.status == :verified
  end

  # good
  def ready?
    if last_reviewed_at > last_updated_at
      worker.update(content, options)
      self.status = :in_progress
    end
    status == :verified
  end
  ```

* As a corollary, avoid shadowing methods with local variables unless they are both equivalent.

  ```Ruby
  class Foo
    attr_accessor :options

    # ok
    def initialize(options)
      self.options = options
      # both options and self.options are equivalent here
    end

    # bad
    def do_something(options = {})
      unless options[:when] == :later
        output(self.options[:message])
      end
    end

    # good
    def do_something(params = {})
      unless params[:when] == :later
        output(options[:message])
      end
    end
  end
  ```

* Don't use the return value of `=` (an assignment) in conditional
  expressions unless the assignment is wrapped in parentheses. This is
  a fairly popular idiom among Rubyists that's sometimes referred to as
  *safe assignment in condition*.

  ```Ruby
  # bad (+ a warning)
  if v = array.grep(/foo/)
    do_something(v)
    ...
  end

  # good (MRI would still complain, but RuboCop won't)
  if (v = array.grep(/foo/))
    do_something(v)
    ...
  end

  # good
  v = array.grep(/foo/)
  if v
    do_something(v)
    ...
  end
  ```

* Use shorthand self assignment operators whenever applicable.

  ```Ruby
  # bad
  x = x + y
  x = x * y
  x = x**y
  x = x / y
  x = x || y
  x = x && y

  # good
  x += y
  x *= y
  x **= y
  x /= y
  x ||= y
  x &&= y
  ```

* Use `||=` to initialize variables only if they're not already initialized.

  ```Ruby
  # bad
  name = name ? name : 'Bozhidar'

  # bad
  name = 'Bozhidar' unless name

  # good - set name to Bozhidar, only if it's nil or false
  name ||= 'Bozhidar'
  ```

* Avoid using Perl-style special variables (like `$:`, `$;`,
  etc. ). They are quite cryptic and their use in anything but
  one-liner scripts is discouraged. Use the human-friendly
  aliases provided by the `English` library.

  ```Ruby
  # bad
  $:.unshift File.dirname(__FILE__)

  # good
  require 'English'
  $LOAD_PATH.unshift File.dirname(__FILE__)
  ```

* Never put a space between a method name and the opening parenthesis.

  ```Ruby
  # bad
  f (3 + 2) + 1

  # good
  f(3 + 2) + 1
  ```

* If the first argument to a method begins with an open parenthesis,
  always use parentheses in the method invocation. For example, write
  `f((3 + 2) + 1)`.

* Favor the use of predicate methods to explicit comparisons with
  `==`. Numeric comparisons are OK.

  ```Ruby
  # bad
  if x % 2 == 0
  end

  if x % 2 == 1
  end

  if x == nil
  end

  # good
  if x.even?
  end

  if x.odd?
  end

  if x.nil?
  end

  if x.zero?
  end

  if x == 0
  end
  ```

## Naming

* Name identifiers in English.

  ```Ruby
  # bad - identifier using non-ascii characters
  заплата = 1_000

  # bad - identifier is a Bulgarian word, written with Latin letters (instead of Cyrillic)
  zaplata = 1_000

  # good
  salary = 1_000
  ```

* Use `snake_case` for symbols, methods and variables.

  ```Ruby
  # bad
  :'some symbol'
  :SomeSymbol
  :someSymbol

  someVar = 5

  def someMethod
    ...
  end

  def SomeMethod
   ...
  end

  # good
  :some_symbol

  def some_method
    ...
  end
  ```

* Use `CamelCase` for classes and modules.  (Keep acronyms like HTTP,
  RFC, XML uppercase.)

  ```Ruby
  # bad
  class Someclass
    ...
  end

  class Some_Class
    ...
  end

  class SomeXml
    ...
  end

  # good
  class SomeClass
    ...
  end

  class SomeXML
    ...
  end
  ```

* Use `snake_case` for naming files, e.g. `hello_world.rb`.

* Use `snake_case` for naming directories, e.g. `lib/hello_world/hello_world.rb`.

* Aim to have just a single class/module per source file. Name the file name as
  the class/module, but replacing CamelCase with snake_case.

* Use `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` for other constants.

  ```Ruby
  # bad
  SomeConst = 5

  # good
  SOME_CONST = 5
  ```

* The names of predicate methods (methods that return a boolean value)
  should end in a question mark.
  (i.e. `Array#empty?`). Methods that don't return a boolean, shouldn't
  end in a question mark.

* The names of potentially *dangerous* methods (i.e. methods that
  modify `self` or the arguments, `exit!` (doesn't run the finalizers
  like `exit` does), etc.) should end with an exclamation mark if
  there exists a safe version of that *dangerous* method.

  ```Ruby
  # bad - there is no matching 'safe' method
  class Person
    def update!
    end
  end

  # good
  class Person
    def update
    end
  end

  # good
  class Person
    def update!
    end

    def update
    end
  end
  ```

* Define the non-bang (safe) method in terms of the bang (dangerous)
  one if possible.

  ```Ruby
  class Array
    def flatten_once!
      res = []

      each do |e|
        [*e].each { |f| res << f }
      end

      replace(res)
    end

    def flatten_once
      dup.flatten_once!
    end
  end
  ```

* Prefer `map` over `collect`, `find` over `detect`, `select` over
  `find_all`, `reduce` over `inject` and `size` over `length`. This is
  not a hard requirement; if the use of the alias enhances
  readability, it's ok to use it. The rhyming methods are inherited from
  Smalltalk and are not common in other programming languages. The
  reason the use of `select` is encouraged over `find_all` is that it
  goes together nicely with `reject` and its name is pretty self-explanatory.

* Don't use `count` as a substitute for `size`. For `Enumerable`
  objects other than `Array` it will iterate the entire collection in
  order to determine its size.

  ```Ruby
  # bad
  some_hash.count

  # good
  some_hash.size
  ```

* Use `flat_map` instead of `map` + `flatten`.
  This does not apply for arrays with a depth greater than 2, i.e.
  if `users.first.songs == ['a', ['b','c']]`, then use `map + flatten` rather than `flat_map`.
  `flat_map` flattens the array by 1, whereas `flatten` flattens it all the way.

  ```Ruby
  # bad
  all_songs = users.map(&:songs).flatten.uniq

  # good
  all_songs = users.flat_map(&:songs).uniq
  ```

* Use `reverse_each` instead of `reverse.each`. `reverse_each` doesn't
  do a new array allocation and that's a good thing.

  ```Ruby
  # bad
  array.reverse.each { ... }

  # good
  array.reverse_each { ... }
  ```

## Comments

* Write self-documenting code and ignore the rest of this section. Seriously!

* Write comments in English.

* Use one space between the leading `#` character of the comment and the text
  of the comment.

* Comments longer than a word are capitalized and use punctuation. Use [one
  space](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentence_spacing) after periods.

* Avoid superfluous comments.

  ```Ruby
  # bad
  counter += 1 # Increments counter by one.
  ```

* Keep existing comments up-to-date. An outdated comment is worse than no comment
  at all.

* Avoid writing comments to explain bad code. Refactor the code to
  make it self-explanatory.

## Classes & Modules

* Use a consistent structure in your class definitions.

  ```Ruby
  class Person
    # extend and include go first
    extend SomeModule
    include AnotherModule

    # constants are next
    SOME_CONSTANT = 20

    # afterwards we have attribute macros
    attr_reader :name

    # followed by other macros (if any)
    validates :name

    # public class methods are next in line
    def self.some_method
    end

    # followed by public instance methods
    def some_method
    end

    # protected and private methods are grouped near the end
    protected

    def some_protected_method
    end

    private

    def some_private_method
    end
  end
  ```

* Don't nest multi line classes within classes. Try to have such nested
  classes each in their own file in a folder named like the containing class.

  ```Ruby
  # bad

  # foo.rb
  class Foo
    class Bar
      # 30 methods inside
    end

    class Car
      # 20 methods inside
    end

    # 30 methods inside
  end

  # good

  # foo.rb
  class Foo
    # 30 methods inside
  end

  # foo/bar.rb
  class Foo
    class Bar
      # 30 methods inside
    end
  end

  # foo/car.rb
  class Foo
    class Car
      # 20 methods inside
    end
  end
  ```

* Prefer modules to classes with only class methods. Classes should be
  used only when it makes sense to create instances out of them.

  ```Ruby
  # bad
  class SomeClass
    def self.some_method
      # body omitted
    end

    def self.some_other_method
    end
  end

  # good
  module SomeClass
    module_function

    def some_method
      # body omitted
    end

    def some_other_method
    end
  end
  ```
* When designing class hierarchies make sure that they conform to the
  [Liskov Substitution Principle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liskov_substitution_principle).

* Try to make your classes as
  [SOLID](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID_\(object-oriented_design\))
  as possible.

* Always supply a proper `to_s` method for classes that represent
  domain objects.

  ```Ruby
  class Person
    attr_reader :first_name, :last_name

    def initialize(first_name, last_name)
      @first_name = first_name
      @last_name = last_name
    end

    def to_s
      "#{@first_name} #{@last_name}"
    end
  end
  ```

* Use the `attr` family of functions to define trivial accessors or mutators.

  ```Ruby
  # bad
  class Person
    def initialize(first_name, last_name)
      @first_name = first_name
      @last_name = last_name
    end

    def first_name
      @first_name
    end

    def last_name
      @last_name
    end
  end

  # good
  class Person
    attr_reader :first_name, :last_name

    def initialize(first_name, last_name)
      @first_name = first_name
      @last_name = last_name
    end
  end
  ```

* Consider adding factory methods to provide additional sensible ways
  to create instances of a particular class.

  ```Ruby
  class Person
    def self.create(options_hash)
      # body omitted
    end
  end
  ```

* Prefer [duck-typing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_typing) over inheritance.

  ```Ruby
  # bad
  class Animal
    # abstract method
    def speak
    end
  end

  # extend superclass
  class Duck < Animal
    def speak
      puts 'Quack! Quack'
    end
  end

  # extend superclass
  class Dog < Animal
    def speak
      puts 'Bau! Bau!'
    end
  end

  # good
  class Duck
    def speak
      puts 'Quack! Quack'
    end
  end

  class Dog
    def speak
      puts 'Bau! Bau!'
    end
  end
  ```

* Avoid the usage of class (`@@`) variables due to their "nasty" behavior in inheritance.

  ```Ruby
  class Parent
    @@class_var = 'parent'

    def self.print_class_var
      puts @@class_var
    end
  end

  class Child < Parent
    @@class_var = 'child'
  end

  Parent.print_class_var # => will print "child"
  ```

  As you can see all the classes in a class hierarchy actually share one
  class variable. Class instance variables should usually be preferred
  over class variables.

* Assign proper visibility levels to methods (`private`, `protected`)
  in accordance with their intended usage. Don't go off leaving
  everything `public` (which is the default).

* Indent the `public`, `protected`, and `private` methods as much the
  method definitions they apply to. Leave one blank line above the
  visibility modifier
  and one blank line below in order to emphasize that it applies to all
  methods below it.

  ```Ruby
  class SomeClass
    def public_method
      # ...
    end

    private

    def private_method
      # ...
    end

    def another_private_method
      # ...
    end
  end
  ```

* Use `def self.method` to define singleton methods. This makes the code
  easier to refactor since the class name is not repeated.

  ```Ruby
  class TestClass
    # bad
    def TestClass.some_method
      # body omitted
    end

    # good
    def self.some_other_method
      # body omitted
    end

    # Also possible and convenient when you
    # have to define many singleton methods.
    class << self
      def first_method
        # body omitted
      end

      def second_method_etc
        # body omitted
      end
    end
  end
  ```

## Collections

* Prefer literal array and hash creation notation (unless you need to
  pass parameters to their constructors, that is).

  ```Ruby
  # bad
  arr = Array.new
  hash = Hash.new

  # good
  arr = []
  hash = {}
  ```

* Prefer `%w` to the literal array syntax when you need an array of
  words (non-empty strings without spaces and special characters in them).
  Apply this rule only to arrays with two or more elements.

  ```Ruby
  # bad
  STATES = ['draft', 'open', 'closed']

  # good
  STATES = %w(draft open closed)
  ```

* Prefer `%i` to the literal array syntax when you need an array of
  symbols (and you don't need to maintain Ruby 1.9 compatibility). Apply
  this rule only to arrays with two or more elements.

  ```Ruby
  # bad
  STATES = [:draft, :open, :closed]

  # good
  STATES = %i(draft open closed)
  ```

* Avoid comma after the last item of an `Array` or `Hash` literal, especially
  when the items are not on separate lines.

  ```Ruby
  # bad - easier to move/add/remove items, but still not preferred
  VALUES = [
             1001,
             2020,
             3333,
           ]

  # bad
  VALUES = [1001, 2020, 3333, ]

  # good
  VALUES = [1001, 2020, 3333]
  ```

* Avoid the creation of huge gaps in arrays.

  ```Ruby
  arr = []
  arr[100] = 1 # now you have an array with lots of nils
  ```

* When accessing the first or last element from an array, prefer `first` or `last` over `[0]` or `[-1]`.

* Use `Set` instead of `Array` when dealing with unique elements. `Set`
  implements a collection of unordered values with no duplicates. This
  is a hybrid of `Array`'s intuitive inter-operation facilities and
  `Hash`'s fast lookup.

* Prefer symbols instead of strings as hash keys.

  ```Ruby
  # bad
  hash = { 'one' => 1, 'two' => 2, 'three' => 3 }

  # good
  hash = { one: 1, two: 2, three: 3 }
  ```

* Avoid the use of mutable objects as hash keys.

* Use the Ruby 1.9 hash literal syntax when your hash keys are symbols.

  ```Ruby
  # bad
  hash = { :one => 1, :two => 2, :three => 3 }

  # good
  hash = { one: 1, two: 2, three: 3 }
  ```

* Don't mix the Ruby 1.9 hash syntax with hash rockets in the same
  hash literal. When you've got keys that are not symbols stick to the
  hash rockets syntax.

  ```Ruby
  # bad
  { a: 1, 'b' => 2 }

  # good
  { :a => 1, 'b' => 2 }
  ```

* Use `Hash#key?` instead of `Hash#has_key?` and `Hash#value?` instead
  of `Hash#has_value?`. As noted
  [here](http://blade.nagaokaut.ac.jp/cgi-bin/scat.rb/ruby/ruby-core/43765)
  by Matz, the longer forms are considered deprecated.

  ```Ruby
  # bad
  hash.has_key?(:test)
  hash.has_value?(value)

  # good
  hash.key?(:test)
  hash.value?(value)
  ```

* Use `Hash#fetch` when dealing with hash keys that should be present.

  ```Ruby
  heroes = { batman: 'Bruce Wayne', superman: 'Clark Kent' }
  # bad - if we make a mistake we might not spot it right away
  heroes[:batman] # => "Bruce Wayne"
  heroes[:supermann] # => nil

  # good - fetch raises a KeyError making the problem obvious
  heroes.fetch(:supermann)
  ```

* Introduce default values for hash keys via `Hash#fetch` as opposed to using custom logic.

  ```Ruby
  batman = { name: 'Bruce Wayne', is_evil: false }

  # bad - if we just use || operator with falsy value we won't get the expected result
  batman[:is_evil] || true # => true

  # good - fetch work correctly with falsy values
  batman.fetch(:is_evil, true) # => false
  ```

* Prefer the use of the block instead of the default value in `Hash#fetch`.

  ```Ruby
  batman = { name: 'Bruce Wayne' }

  # bad - if we use the default value, we eager evaluate it
  # so it can slow the program down if done multiple times
  batman.fetch(:powers, get_batman_powers) # get_batman_powers is an expensive call

  # good - blocks are lazy evaluated, so only triggered in case of KeyError exception
  batman.fetch(:powers) { get_batman_powers }
  ```

* Use `Hash#values_at` when you need to retrieve several values consecutively from a hash.

  ```Ruby
  # bad
  email = data['email']
  nickname = data['nickname']

  # good
  email, username = data.values_at('email', 'nickname')
  ```

* Never modify a collection while traversing it.

## Strings

* Prefer string interpolation and string formatting instead of string concatenation:

  ```Ruby
  # bad
  email_with_name = user.name + ' <' + user.email + '>'

  # good
  email_with_name = "#{user.name} <#{user.email}>"
  ```

  * Prefer double-quotes unless your string literal
    contains `"` or escape characters you want to suppress.

    ```Ruby
    # bad
    name = 'Bozhidar'

    # good
    name = "Bozhidar"
    ```

* Don't use `Object#to_s` on interpolated objects. It's invoked on them automatically.

  ```Ruby
  # bad
  message = "This is the #{result.to_s}."

  # good
  message = "This is the #{result}."
  ```

## Metaprogramming

* Avoid needless metaprogramming.

* Do not mess around in core classes when writing libraries.
  (Do not monkey-patch them.)

* Avoid using `method_missing` for metaprogramming because backtraces become messy,
  the behavior is not listed in `#methods`, and misspelled method calls might silently
  work, e.g. `nukes.launch_state = false`. Consider using delegation, proxy, or
  `define_method` instead. If you must use `method_missing`:

  - Be sure to [also define `respond_to_missing?`](http://blog.marc-andre.ca/2010/11/methodmissing-politely.html)
  - Only catch methods with a well-defined prefix, such as `find_by_*` -- make your code as assertive as possible.
  - Call `super` at the end of your statement
  - Delegate to assertive, non-magical methods:

    ```ruby
    # bad
    def method_missing?(meth, *args, &block)
      if /^find_by_(?<prop>.*)/ =~ meth
        # ... lots of code to do a find_by
      else
        super
      end
    end

    # good
    def method_missing?(meth, *args, &block)
      if /^find_by_(?<prop>.*)/ =~ meth
        find_by(prop, *args, &block)
      else
        super
      end
    end

    # best of all, though, would to define_method as each findable attribute is declared
    ```

## Misc

* Avoid hashes as optional parameters. Does the method do too much? (Object initializers are exceptions for this rule).

* Avoid methods longer than 10 LOC (lines of code). Ideally, most methods will be shorter than
  5 LOC. Empty lines do not contribute to the relevant LOC.

* Avoid parameter lists longer than three or four parameters.

* Prefer `Time.now` over `Time.new` when retrieving the current system time.

* Code in a functional way, avoiding mutation when that makes sense.

* Do not mutate arguments unless that is the purpose of the method.

* Avoid more than three levels of block nesting.

* Be consistent. In an ideal world, be consistent with these guidelines.

* Use common sense.
